Installation
============

1. Generate an Akindi API key:

  a. Login to Akindi, then click *LMS Integrations* under the
     "Administration" heading on the left nav bar (if you don't see the *LMS
     Integrations* options, please `contact akindi`__ so we can give your
     account access to LMS integration options).

  b. Click "Add LMS Integration" and fill out the form. Make sure that the
     *LMS URL* field begins with ``https://`` and contains the complete
     path to the location Akindi's local plugin will be installed. The URL is
     usually similar to
     ``https://moodle.yourschool.com/moodle/local/akindi``.

  c. Make note of the "Public Key" and "Secret Key"; you'll need these in
     step 8.

8. Under the Administration panel, expand *Plugins*, then *Local plugins*, and
   click *Akindi Settings*. Fill in the values appropriate to your
   installation:

   ``akindi_launch_url``
       | Testing: ``https://akindistg.com/api/moodle/launch``
       | Production: ``https://akindi.com/api/moodle/launch``

   ``akindi_public_key``
       The public key from step 1 (it will start with ``pk_``).

   ``akindi_secret_key``
       The secret key from step 1 (it will start with ``sk_``).

   ``akindi_instance_secret``
       A secret key you have generated which *should not* be shared with
       Akindi. The default value is generated randomly on each page load and
       is a suitable default.

       This key is used to sign tokens sent to Akindi and should not be
       changed after the initial application setup.

9. Test your integration: navigate to a course, expand *Course
   administration*, then click *Launch Akindi*!

Usage Notes
===========

Akindi assumes that student's ``idnumber`` field will be a numeric student ID.
Akindi will still function if it isn't, but the instructor will have to manually
assign each scanned sheet to a student.
